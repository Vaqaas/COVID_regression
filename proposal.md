# Cancer Mortality rates in the United States and Puerto Rico

Cancer mortality rates are quite prevalent, and an interested individual can find data on a particular cancer. However, this data can be misleading, as the data covers a population rather than an individual. Since individuals in a population do not share equal medical or demographic data, knowing the general mortality rate for a certain cancer doesn't translate well to an individual patient. The problem that we're addressing is predicting accurately the risk of cancer in individual patients by using  their respective demographic and biometric data. 

The data will be obtained from the Center of Disease Control Website. The important features as mentioned will be primarily demographic and biometric, and the individual data points will be individual patients. More specifically, we will highlight the state in which they live, their height, weight, age, and if possible, any risk factors. As the project progresses, more features either observed or engineered will be added. 

Once the inital exploratory data analysis is conducted, we will began using numerous regression techniques to predict mortality rate. A minimum viable product for such a project would be a model that, given individual patients represented by demographic and biometric features, will provide their respective mortality rates.
