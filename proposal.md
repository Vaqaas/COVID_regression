# COVID-19 Hospitalization/Mortality rates in the United States and Puerto Rico

COVID-19 has affected the entire world in, what now seems and irreparable way. Knowing the challenges that are ahead of us, we can use much information as we can to mitigate further losses due to COVID. The data is split up by county and includes case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations, for 3000+ US Counties and outlying regions. The problem we are addressing is predicting the rise in mortalities depending on county.

The data was scraped utilizing BeautifulSoup and Selenium from the New York Times coverage of COVID-19. There will likely be a lot of setup to data scraped from the web page, and following that, we will begin some exploratory data analysis. At that point, we can start to model total COVID deaths as a function of previously collected data from each county.
