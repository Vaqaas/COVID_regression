# Determining the probability of match wins in Professional League of Legends 

What started as simply another means of entertainment, League of Legends has now turned into a cornerstone of E-Sports. It's wild growth has resulted in player contracts
of seven figures and prize pools of multi-million dollars. With such a nuanced, high skill-capped game, it becomes difficult to determine the strength of the teams and
players at the top of the League of Legends pro scene. 

Utilizing data from sources such as [Oracle's Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/) and the [Riot Games Company API](https://developer.riotgames.com/), we will isolate 
features that most significantly correlate with success in the League Pro Scene. Details like Gold and Experience difference between opposing players, participation
in team fights, roaming potential are all important, but these are only a fraction of the features provided by the previously mentioned data sources. 

We propose that in this gold mine of data, there are 'diamonds' that have been previously overlooked. Leveraging numerous forms of regression models, we can discover
the most important qualifiers in leading to wins or advantages. Then, using these qualifiers, we can estimate a regression model that can determine what a player,
coach of team owner must focus on to lead to the highest possible probability of winning and optimal performance.
