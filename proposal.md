# Cancer Mortality rates in the United States and Puerto Rico

The problem that we're addressing is predicting accurately the risk of cancer in patients by using demographic and basic biometric data. 

The data will be obtained from the Center of Disease Control Website. The important features as mentioned will be primarily demographic and biometric, and the individual data points will be individual patients. More specifically, we will highlight the state in which they live, their height, weight, age, and if possible, any risk factors. As the project progresses, more features either observed or engineered will be added. 

Once the inital exploratory data analysis is conducted, we will began using numerous regression techniques to predict mortality rate.
